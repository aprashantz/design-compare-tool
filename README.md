# Design Comparison Tool

This web application compares a Figma design screenshot with a screenshot of the built screen, focusing on UI components such as text colors, buttons, and other similar elements. The tool is built using Flask and Python, with a neumorphic design for the user interface.

## Features

- Upload two images: Figma design screenshot and built screen screenshot
- Compare design specifications (colors, UI components)
- Generate useful comparison results
- Neumorphic web interface

## How it works

1. User uploads two images through the web interface
2. User clicks the "Compare" button to start the analysis
3. The application processes the images and compares the design elements
4. Results are displayed on the web page

## Technologies Used

- Flask (Python web framework)
- Python image processing libraries (e.g., Pillow, OpenCV)
- HTML, CSS (for neumorphic design), and JavaScript
