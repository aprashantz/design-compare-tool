# Design Comparison Tool: Bridging UI/UX Design and Implementation

## Overview

The Design Comparison Tool is a web application that quantitatively compares Figma design screenshots with implemented screen captures. It provides:

1. A structural similarity score
2. Visual representation of design discrepancies

## Target Users

- UI/UX Developers
- Design Teams
- Quality Assurance Professionals

## Functionality

1. Image Upload: Figma design and implemented screen
2. Image Processing: Utilizes computer vision techniques
3. Comparison Generation: Produces a composite image highlighting differences
4. Results: Outputs a similarity score and visual discrepancy map

## Core Technologies

- Flask: Python web framework for backend operations
- OpenCV: Image processing and computer vision tasks
- Scikit-image: Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) calculation
- NumPy: Efficient array operations and data manipulation

## Technical Details: Image Comparison Process

1. Image Preprocessing:

   - Images are read using OpenCV
   - Figma design image is resized to match the built screen dimensions
   - Both images are converted to grayscale

2. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) Calculation:

   - Scikit-image's SSIM function compares the grayscale images
   - Measures similarity based on luminance, contrast, and structure
   - Outputs a similarity score and difference image

3. Difference Analysis:

   - Difference image is normalized and thresholded using Otsu's method
   - Contours are detected in the thresholded image

4. Visualization:

   - Significant differences (contours > 40 pixels) are highlighted
   - Green rectangles on Figma design, red on built screen
   - A filled version shows differences in red

5. Result Generation:
   - Composite image created by stacking annotated images
   - Similarity score converted to percentage
   - Unique filename generated using current date and time

## Key Benefits

- Accelerates design review processes
- Enhances design-development team communication
- Provides quantitative metrics for design fidelity
- Facilitates early detection of design inconsistencies

## Future Developments

- AI-driven suggestions for design discrepancy resolution
- Integration with popular design and development platforms

## Conclusion

The Design Comparison Tool offers an objective, efficient method for ensuring design implementation accuracy, streamlining the UI/UX development workflow.
